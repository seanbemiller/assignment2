		I) Inheritenace is the process of classes inheriting data/functions from parent classes.
		II) Polymorphism is when a class is interprited differently, like an int being used in

	i) dictators merge/conflic resolve lieutenants repositories while 
	a lieutenants merge/conflic resolve changes for the developers
	j) with the lieutenant/dictator workflow the developers could focus more on development and 
	worry less about having mergconflics and the lieutenants only have to manage a certain amount
	of potential merge conlfics. the director then only has to merge the lieutenants repositories,
	as aposed to every individual haveing to habdel merge conflicts potentially whent when every
	the push ot the repository like in a centeralized workflow.
